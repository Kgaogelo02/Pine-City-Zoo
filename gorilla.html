        <h3>GORILLA</h3>
        <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates and are found in forests across central Africa. They live in groups led by a dominant male known as a silverback.</p>
        <p>Gorillas are strong but gentle and intelligent, capable of using tools and showing emotions. They are primarily herbivores and spend most of their time foraging and resting.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the gorillas at pen P09, in the tropical forest section.</p>
