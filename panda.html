        <h3>PANDA</h3>
        <p>Pandas are native to China and are known for their black-and-white fur and love of bamboo. They are a symbol of wildlife conservation efforts worldwide.</p>
        <p>Although bears, they are mostly herbivores. Pandas are shy, gentle, and spend most of their day eating and resting.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the pandas at pen P22, beside the bamboo grove.</p>
