        <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
        <p>Warthogs are wild pigs native to Africa, recognized by their large tusks and warty faces. Despite their looks, they are fast and surprisingly agile.</p>
        <p>They live in burrows and prefer open plains. Warthogs often kneel on their front legs to graze and can defend themselves fiercely when threatened.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the warthogs at pen W18, in the grasslands area.</p>
