        <h3>KOALA</h3>
        <p>Koalas are marsupials native to Australia. They are known for their fluffy ears, large noses, and their diet of eucalyptus leaves.</p>
        <p>Koalas sleep up to 20 hours a day due to their low-energy diet and spend most of their lives in trees. They are a symbol of Australian wildlife.</p>
        <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
        <p>You will find the koalas at pen K12, near the Australian Outback exhibit.</p>
